# School District Analysis
## Overview
In this project, we used the pandas library in python to analyze standardized math and reading test scores for a city school district in order to identify trends in performance by school, school type, grade, spending per student, as well as other categories.  Our input file listed the standardized test scores of each student, as well as other useful information (school, grade level, gender, and others).

# Data Concerns
One concern with the data is that the ninth grade reading and math grades for one high school, Thomas High School, appeared to have been altered.  For this reason, two separate analyses were performed: one with all of the student scores and one in which the scores for Thomas High School ninth graders were removed.

# Results
