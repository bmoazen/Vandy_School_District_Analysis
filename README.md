# School District Analysis
## Overview
In this project, we used the pandas library in python to analyze standardized math and reading test scores for a city school district in order to identify trends in performance by school, school type, grade, spending per student, as well as other categories.  Our input file listed the standardized test scores of each student, as well as other useful information (school, grade level, gender, and others).
